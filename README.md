# Unhandled Empty Response in React Fetch Data

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications when fetching data: failure to handle empty or non-JSON responses from an API. The `bug.js` file contains a component that fetches data but doesn't handle scenarios where the API returns an empty response or a response that isn't valid JSON. This can lead to silent errors or unexpected behavior in the application. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses these issues.

## Bug

The `bug.js` component fetches data using the `fetch` API. However, it lacks proper error handling for cases where the API response is empty or does not contain valid JSON data. This can result in the application crashing or displaying unexpected results.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` component addresses the bug by adding checks to handle the following scenarios:

*   **Empty Response:** Checks if the response body is empty before attempting to parse it as JSON.
*   **Invalid JSON:** Uses a `try...catch` block to handle potential errors during JSON parsing.
*   **Non-2xx Status Codes:** Checks the HTTP status code of the response to ensure the request was successful. 

By handling these scenarios, the application becomes more robust and less prone to unexpected crashes or errors.
